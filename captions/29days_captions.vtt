00:00:00.042 --> 00:00:08.100
This is a science mission on par with the Apollo missions, the space shuttle, International Space Station and the Hubble missions. 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.700
For nearly two decades, thousands

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:17.893
of people, around the world, many spending their entire careers, built the James Webb Space Telescope.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.607
And it all comes down to this. 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:34.910
Once we launch the James Webb Space Telescope, there are no second chances. 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:41.168
We have 300 single-point failure items and they all have to work right.

00:00:41.168 --> 00:00:46.255
When you're a million miles away from the Earth, you can't send someone to fix it. 

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:59.950
We've never put a telescope this large in space. We want to see distant parts of the universe humans have never seen before.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:06.480
Looking back in time almost 14 billion years to see the first galaxies that formed after

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.760
The Big Bang. And, we want to search for the building blocks of life in the atmospheres

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:18.610
of planets orbiting distant stars. To unfold the history of the universe, we must first

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.040
unfold this telescope. 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.838
This is the largest primary mirror, the largest sunshield, and

00:01:27.871 --> 00:01:33.940
the most powerful space telescope ever built. And yet, this large telescope needs to fit

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:40.260
inside a 5.4 meter diameter rocket fairing. That's the largest fairing size available

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.022
on any rocket, and it's the fairing size on our ride to space, the Ariane 5 

00:01:45.022 --> 00:01:52.020
provided by the European Space Agency is one of the world's most powerful rockets. To cheat the fairing

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:59.453
size limit, we built Webb to fold like origami, to fit inside the rocket fairing.

00:01:59.453 --> 00:02:03.510
And this brings us to the most challenging part of this mission: Unfolding

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:12.120
it in space. Six. Cinq. Quatre. Think of what you are doing. You're taking this extraordinarily

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.200
delicate, precise, state-of-the-art scientific instrument, and you're slapping it on a rocket

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.872
and for the next 8 minutes, the explosion from that rocket is following you into outer space.

00:02:26.081 --> 00:02:31.383
Vibrating you. Shaking you. 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.549
Everything that goes into outer space has to live through this environment and work once it gets there, 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.254
without having someone come to fix it.

00:02:48.164 --> 00:02:54.342
Two weeks. That's how long it will take to fully deploy the Webb Telescope. We can take longer if we need

00:02:54.342 --> 00:02:58.220
to, but those two weeks after launch are going to be nail-bitters. 

00:02:58.641 --> 00:03:03.725
This is the MissionOperations Center at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore. 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.872
Those 2 weeks after launch will be like our Super Bowl, World Cup, you pick the analogy. 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.901
Years of training comes down to these moments. 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.633
The Webb Observatory has about 50 major

00:03:17.633 --> 00:03:24.860
deployments. 50, depending on how you categorize them. And 178 release mechanisms must work

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:32.410
to deploy those 50 parts. Every single one of them must work. Unfolding Webb is hands

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.920
down, the most complicated spacecraft activity we've ever done. Then again, nothing about

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:44.160
Webb is easy, we've never done this before. There's nothing simple about sending anything

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.770
into space. You can't do it without taking risks. 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.470
This mission is squarely in new spacecraft territory. Webb is the perfect example of science desire

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:04.510
driving engineering capability to new frontiers. Webb's unique design is born from

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.832
reasoned engineering to accomplish its science goals. 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.500
Here is the plan. Shortly after launch,

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.136
we unfold Webb's solar panel for power, and a high gain antenna for communication. 

00:04:21.136 --> 00:04:24.270
About 12 hours later, we have an important engine

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.639
firing that sends Webb on the proper course toward its orbital destination, about 1 million

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:36.009
miles away. That's where Webb will do its science. Webb will be moving so fast, it passes the

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:40.620
Moon's orbit in one and a half days, half the time it took Apollo astronauts to reach

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:48.289
Lunar orbit. First, we lower the sunshield pallets, then raise Webb's primary mirror

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:53.009
and instruments away from the sunshield. The solar wind will push us around

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:58.419
with the sunshield open, so we'll unfold a trim tab to help keep us stable. We've got

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:03.819
this huge iconic golden segmented mirrors that will help us deliver amazing new images of

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:08.589
the cosmos. But in some ways the sunshield is a lot more complicated, and it's just as

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:16.129
essential. Without it, nothing works. Here we've got 5 sunshield layers, approximately 8900 square

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:20.499
feet, almost the size of 3 tennis courts of very thin Kapton

00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:26.289
material about one to two thousanths of an inch thick. Making them go where you want

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:33.279
them to go in zero-G, is extremely challenging. The sunshield shades the telescope from the

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:38.349
heat of the Sun, Earth and Moon. The concept is simple but, there's nothing simple about

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:44.960
the design or operation, especially when you get in space. Webb's sunshield assembly includes

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:51.889
140 release mechanisms. approximately 70 hinge assemblies, 8 deployment motors, bearings,

00:05:51.889 --> 00:06:00.499
springs and gears, about 400 pulleys and 90 cables totaling 1312 feet. All this just to

00:06:00.499 --> 00:06:07.680
keep the sunshield under control as it unfolds. First, we release these special restraints

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:12.030
that protect the sunshield during launch. They roll out of the way, but not all the

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:19.139
way until we are ready to deploy a side. Next, we release a set of covers over the core region.

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:28.289
Now comes the critical point - All 107 sunshield release mechanisms need to fire on cue. 107.

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:33.018
They free the five sunshield layers, allowing them to extend as the mid-booms deploy.

00:06:48.189 --> 00:06:53.490
With the sunshield fully deployed, we start setting up the optics. First, the secondary mirror

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:59.020
is extended and locked into place. And a special radiator behind Webb is extended which helps

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:04.639
further lower the temperature of the science instruments. Finally, we open the primary mirror's

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:12.250
wings and lock them in place. With that done, Webb is in its final configuration.

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:20.259
But we're not done yet. After 47 deployments, and accomplishing the hardest spacecraft unfolding

00:07:20.259 --> 00:07:26.449
NASA has ever done, Webb still won't be ready for science. While the instruments cool, we'll

00:07:26.449 --> 00:07:31.629
control motors behind each of Webb's 18 mirror segments, the secondary mirror and 

00:07:31.629 --> 00:07:37.979
the fine steering mirror located inside the center of the primary mirror. We'll precisely align

00:07:37.979 --> 00:07:44.479
the mirror segments to form a perfect mirror. Then, Webb will be ready to explore the cosmos.
