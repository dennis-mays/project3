                        This is a science mission on par with the Apollo
                        missions, the space shuttle, International Space Station
                        and Hubble missions. For nearly two decades, thousands
                        of people, around the world, many spending their entire
                        careers, built the James Webb Space Telescope. And it
                        all comes down to this.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once we launch the James Webb Space Telescope there are
                        no second chances. We have 300 single-point failure
                        items and they all have to work right. When you're a
                        million miles away from the Earth, you can't send
                        someone to fix it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We've never put a telescope this large in space. We want
                        to see distant parts of the universe humans have never
                        seen before. Looking back in time almost 14 billion
                        years to see the first galaxies that formed after The
                        Big Bang. And, we want to search for the building blocks
                        of life in the atmospheres of planets orbiting distant
                        stars. To unfold the history of the universe, we must
                        first unfold this telescope.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This is the largest primary mirror, the largest
                        sunshield, and the most powerful space telescope ever
                        built. And yet, this large telescope needs to fit inside
                        a 5.4 meter diameter rocket fairing. That's the largest
                        fairing size available on any rocket, and it's the
                        fairing size on our ride to space, the Ariane 5 provided
                        by the European Space Agency is one of the world's most
                        powerful rockets. To cheat the fairing size limit, we
                        built Webb to fold like origami, to fit inside the
                        rocket fairing.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        And this brings us to the most challenging part of this
                        mission: Unfolding it in space. Think of what you are
                        doing. You're taking this extraordinarily delicate,
                        precise, state-of-the-art scientific instrument, and
                        you're slapping it on a rocket and for the next 8
                        minutes, the explosion from that rocket is following you
                        into outer space. Vibrating you. Shaking you. Everything
                        that goes into outer space has to live through this
                        environment and work once it gets there, without having
                        someone come to fix it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Two weeks. That's how long it will take to fully deploy
                        the Webb Telescope. We can take longer if we need to,
                        but those two weeks after launch are going to be
                        nail-bitters. This is the Mission Operations Center at
                        the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore.
                        Those 2 weeks after launch will be like our Super Bowl,
                        World Cup, you pick the analogy. Years of training comes
                        down to these moments.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The Webb Observatory has 50 major deployments. 50,
                        depending on how you categorize them. And 178 release
                        mechanisms must work to deploy those 50 parts. Every
                        single one of them must work. Unfolding Webb is hands
                        down, the most complicated spacecraft activity we've
                        ever done. Then again, nothing about Webb is easy, we've
                        never done this before. There's nothing simple about
                        sending anything into space. You can't do it without
                        taking risks.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This mission is squarely in new spacecraft territory.
                        Webb is the perfect example of science desire driving
                        engineering capability to new frontiers. Webb's unique
                        design was born from reasoned engineering to accomplish
                        its science goals.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Here's the plan. Shortly after launch, we unfold Webb's
                        solar panel for power, and a high gain antenna for
                        communication. About 12 hours later, we have an
                        important engine firing that sends Webb on the proper
                        course toward its orbital destination, about 1 million
                        miles away. That's where Webb will do its science. Webb
                        will be moving so fast, it passes the Moon's orbit in
                        one and a half days, half the time it took Apollo
                        astronauts to reach Lunar orbit. First, we lower the
                        sunshield pallets, then raise Webb's primary mirror and
                        instruments away from the sunshield. The solar wind will
                        push us around with the sunshield open, so we'll unfold
                        a trim tab to help keep us stable.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We've got these huge iconic golden segmented mirrors
                        that will help us deliver amazing new images of the
                        cosmos. But in some ways the sunshield is a lot more
                        complicated, and it's just as essential. Without it,
                        nothing works. Here we've got 5 sunshield layers,
                        approximately 8900 square feet, almost the size of 3
                        tennis courts of very thin Kapton material about one to
                        two thousanths of an inch thick. Making them go where
                        you want them to go in zero-G, is extremely challenging.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The sunshield shades the telescope from the heat of the
                        Sun, Earth and Moon. The concept is simple but, there's
                        nothing simple about the design or operation, especially
                        when you get to space. Webb's sunshield assembly
                        includes 140 release mechanisms, approximately 70 hinge
                        assemblies, 8 deployment motors, bearings, springs and
                        gears, about 400 pulleys and 90 cables totaling 1312
                        feet. All this just to keep the sunshield under control
                        as it unfolds.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        First, we release these special restraints that protect
                        the sunshield during launch. They roll out of the way,
                        but not all the way until we are ready to deploy a side.
                        Next, we release a set of covers over the core region.
                        Now comes the critical point, all 107 sunshield release
                        mechanisms need to fire on cue. 107. They free the five
                        sunshield layers, allowing them to extend as the
                        mid-booms deploy.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        With the sunshield fully deployed, we start setting up
                        the optics. First, the secondary mirror is extended and
                        locked into place. And a special radiator behind Webb is
                        extended which helps further lower the temperature of
                        the science instruments. Finally, we open the primary
                        mirror's wings and lock them in place. With that done,
                        Webb is in its final configuration. But we're not done
                        yet.

                        After 47 deployments, and accomplishing the hardest
                        spacecraft unfolding NASA has ever done, Webb still
                        won't be ready for science. While the instruments cool,
                        we'll control motors behind each of Webb's 18 mirror
                        segments, the secondary mirror and the fine steering
                        mirror located inside the center of the primary mirror.
                        We'll precisely align the mirror segments to form a
                        perfect mirror. Then, Webb will be ready to explore the
                        cosmos.
